3. **Verify the Installation**

   - Check if SASS is successfully installed by running:
     ```bash
     sass --version
     ```
   - This should display the installed version of SASS.

4. **Set Up a Test Environment**

   - Create a test directory and navigate into it:
     ```bash
     mkdir sass-test
     cd sass-test
     ```
   - Create a `.scss` file to test:
     ```bash
     echo "$primary-color: #333; body { color: $primary-color; }" > test.scss
     ```

5. **Compile the SASS File**
